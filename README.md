#### Professional Experience
I have experience in the administrative field, where I worked on improving business process efficiency. Thanks to this experience, I decided to delve into data analytics and in 2023, I commenced training in the Yandex Practicum course "Data Analytics". My key skills include advanced data handling in Excel and Python using pandas and NumPy libraries. I excel in data analysis and information structuring.
